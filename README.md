# Classification of Alzheimer's MRI images
Classification of MRI images of the first 4 stages of Alzheimer's disease using various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

**This project includes :**  
• Training different convolutional bases [VGG16, Xception, DenseNet201] using transfer learning techniques with a top validation AUC Score of 90%.  
• Improvement of CNN architectures in order to fit the problem of classifying Alzheimer's early stages.  
• Development of an interactive image classification Web Application using Django.
